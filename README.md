======
This repository dedicated to my `HowTo's` tips and tricks. Also I plan to publish the installation procedures and other things which could be written in `Mark Down` text files.  

I have noticed that instructions are often fragmentary and I have to spend hours searching for the right information. These `HowTo's` texts are my attempt to solve this problem at least for myself. If it helps others - **welcome**. These texts can be adjusted over time.
